# Gitting to know you
Fill in the text below with your own answers to each question. Each person in your group should submit their answers in a separate commit, but all of your answers should appear together in the file. Please add your answers after the `>` character so your answers will appear as quotes in the rendered markdown. To make it clear who has written each response, please preface each answer with your first name. For example, if Jordan writes a response to the question "What is your favorite typographical symbol?" the line should read "> Jordan: My favorite typographical symbol is the octothorp."

What happens if you miss a day of class because you are sick or your alarm doesn't go off?
>  It depends on the day. If it is a lab day, then you will get a 20% penalty on that lab. However, if it is any other day, there is no penalty for not attending class. Instead, you will have to do a lot of work outside of class in order to catch up with the material that was taught that day. One caveat is that in the case that you are sick, the penalty for the lab may be waived if you turn in documentation from SHACS proving that you were indeed sick.

What happens if you turn in a lab late?
> Late lab receives a full letter grade (10%) deduction for each day it is late
